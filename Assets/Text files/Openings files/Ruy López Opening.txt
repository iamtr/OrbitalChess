One of the oldest and most classical chess openings, 
is the Ruy López Opening (also known as the Spanish Opening)
Let's dive into the main ideas and variations of the Ruy López:

@e4 
@e5
Both players establish a central pawn presence.

@Nf3
@Nc6
These moves aim to control the center and develop the knights.

@Bb5
The Ruy López begins with this move, known as the Ruy López Exchange.
White pins Black's knight to the king, putting immediate pressure on the e5 pawn and the knight.

Now, depending on Black's response, there are several popular variations within the Ruy López:
We will be focusing on one of the variation: The Schliemann Defense, 
also known as the Jaenisch Gambit.
It is one of Black's most aggressive ways of meeting the Ruy López.

@ 3...f5
Black immediately challenges the e4 pawn, sacrificing a pawn for active piece play, 
instead of building a solid position and playing for equality.
The imbalanced positions that arise from this variation are difficult to navigate for both sides.

@ Nc3
White usually plays this move to counterattack in the center,
developing the knight and putting pressure on the d5 pawn.

@ 4...fxe4
Black captures the e4 pawn, accepting the gambit and opening lines for piece activity.
