Firstly, let’s talk about pawns.
Pawns can move one square forward,
or two squares forward on their first move.
They capture pieces diagonally forward.
Demo
If a pawn reaches to the end of the board,
you can promote it into either of the 4 different pieces:
queen, knight, rook or bishop.
Demo
One last bonus rule of pawns is en passant which might like look bizarre,
where you capture the opponent pawn as if it’s moved only one square.
There is only one requirement for en passant to be a valid move:
The captured pawn must have moved two squares in one move in the previous move.
Demo
Knights move in an "L" shape,
two squares in one direction and one square in another,
where it jumps over other pieces,
so the knight can still move over to this square even when its path is occupied by other pieces.
Demo
Bishops are simple, they can move any number of squares diagonally,
where rooks can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
Demo
The queen is a combined version of the rook and bishop,
and can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
It’s the most powerful piece in the game, so use it wisely and carefully.
Demo
Lastly, the king. The king can only one square in any direction.
Demo
A special move that a king can do is castling,
where you move both the king and rook at the same time;
the king will move two squares towards the rook...
and that rook is placed on the square over which the king crossed.
You can only do castling when there are no pieces occupying between the two pieces...
and neither the king nor the rook have previously moved.
Demo
The king is the most important piece in the game,
where the strategy revolves protecting your king and threatening your opponent's.
