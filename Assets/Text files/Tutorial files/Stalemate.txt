When the king is NOT in check, AND there are no legal moves left,
This results in a stalemate, ending the game in a draw.

Let's try it out! Black seems doomed, but can you use stalemate to your advantage?
Well done! A check is made by Black's pawn.
No matter what White does next, Black will stalemate the game and win.
This is because Black's king has no valid moves.
