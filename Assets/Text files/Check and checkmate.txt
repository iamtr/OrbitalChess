When a piece’s next move is able to ‘capture’ the king,
the king is under attack, or in ”check”.
If the king is in check, we need to find a way to avoid check.
There are three ways to avoid check:
1- Moving the king to an adjacent non-threated square; 
2- Move a piece to block the line of threat,
which is not possible when the attacking piece is a knight or a pawn,
or when there are two pieces attacking simultaneously;
3- Capture the attacking piece
