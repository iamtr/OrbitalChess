Checkmate occurs when the opponent’s king is under attack (in “check”)...
and is unable to make a legal move to escape capture.

Let's try it out! Checkmate your opponent with only one move.
Well done! The rook checks Black's king and there is no safe square to dodge the check.

Let's try it out! Checkmate your opponent with only one move.
As you can see, it does not matter if your opponent has more pieces on the board,
You can still checkmate your opponent if they are careless.

The ultimate goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent’s king.
