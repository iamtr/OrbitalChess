King's Pawn Opening

This is the most aggressive and most attacking first move because it immediately stakes a claim to the center and frees up the queen and king bishop. This allows control of key central squares, fast piece development and quick kingside castling; however, it prolongs the offensive pressure on Black if defend properly.
