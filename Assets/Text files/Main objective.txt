The ultimate goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent’s king.
Checkmate occurs when the opponent’s king is under attack (in “check”)...
and is unable to make a legal move to escape capture.
When the king is NOT in check, AND there are no legal moves left,
this results in a stalemate, ending the game in a draw.
Let's try it out! Checkmate your opponent with only one move.
