There are a few common strategies you can use in chess.
The first is centre control.
Controlling the centre is important in early game...
as it offers greater mobility and flexibility.
Second is piece development.
During the opening, it's critical to move your pieces (knights, bishops, and rooks)
from their initial positions to active squares,
ideally in the board's centre.
It is recommended to safeguard your king by casting
as it gets the king out of the middle, hiding it on the side.
Tactical opportunities are very useful in chess
as it limits the opponent movement to give you the edge.
Examples are forks, where you attack two pieces at the same time;
Pins, restricting the movement of an opponentâ€™s piece;
And skewers, forcing the opponent to play a more valuable piece.
