There are a few common strategies you can use in chess.
The first is centre control.
Controlling the centre is important in early game
as it offers greater mobility and flexibility.

Second is piece development.
During the opening, it's critical to move your pieces (knights, bishops, and rooks)
from their initial positions to active squares,
ideally in the board's centre.

It is recommended to safeguard your king by casting
as it gets the king out of the middle, hiding it on the side.

Tactical opportunities are very useful in chess
as it limits the opponent movement to give you the edge.

Examples are forks, where you attack multiple pieces at the same time;
Let's try it out! Fork both of the opponent's rooks!
Well done! The knight is able to attack both rooks,
but it still out of their range.
Even if the knight is captured later by the rook, 
it results in a net positive piece value for you!
Forks that are forceful are the most lethal.
Those forks typically include an assault on the opposing king and pose an unavoidable danger.
Let's try it out! Create a fork that checks the king.
Since the White king is in check, and there are no availble move for it to avoid check,
it must be move to a different square.
The rook in result cannot be saved.

Pins, restricting the movement of an opponentâ€™s piece;

And skewers, forcing the opponent to play a more valuable piece.
