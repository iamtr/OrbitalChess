When a piece’s next move is able to ‘capture’ the king,
the king is under attack, or in ”check”.

If the king is in check, we need to find ways to avoid checking.
There are three ways to avoid checking:
1- Moving the king to an adjacent non-threated square;
Let's try it out! Move the king away from the attacking queen!

2- Move a piece to block the line of threat,
which is not possible when the attacking piece is a knight or a pawn,
or when there are two pieces attacking simultaneously;
Let's try it out! Block the attacking queen!

3- Capture the attacking piece
Let's try it out! Capture the attacking queen.
